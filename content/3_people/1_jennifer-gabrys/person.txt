Jennifer Gabrys is Chair in Media, Culture and Environment in the Department of Sociology at the University of Cambridge. She was previously Professor in Sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London, where she is currently an honorary Visiting Professor. Gabrys is Principal Investigator on the European Research Council (ERC) Proof of Concept grant, “AirKit.” She also leads the  Citizen Sense project, which received funding through an ERC Starting Grant (2013-2018).

Her research investigates the intersection of social practices, environments and communication technologies through theoretical and practice-based work. Projects within this area include, Digital Rubbish: A Natural History of Electronics (University of Michigan Press, 2011); Program Earth: Environmental Sensing Technology and the Making of a Computational Planet (University of Minnesota Press, 2016); and How to Do Things with Sensors (University of Minnesota Press Forerunners series, 2019).

Gabrys has been a Co-Investigator on the RCUK Energy Programme and ESRC-funded project, “Sustainability Invention and Energy Demand Reduction: Co-designing Communities and Practice.” This study, which was a collaboration with Mike Michael, Bill Gaver and the Interaction Research Studio, investigated how new technologies might be designed to engage communities in reducing energy consumption.
